      "summary": "Conspiracy theory claiming a secretive elite cabal is working to establish a totalitarian world government, eliminating national sovereignty. The theory misinterprets international cooperation and legitimate global organizations as evidence of conspiracy.",
      "full": "The New World Order (NWO) conspiracy theory posits that a powerful elite cabal is secretly working to establish a totalitarian world government that would eliminate national sovereignty, individual freedoms, and traditional institutions. Alleged architects include the United Nations, European Union, Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, Illuminati, and Freemasons. Elements commonly cited include population control, microchipping, cashless society, martial law, and FEMA camps. The theory emerged from post-WWI/WWII discussions of international cooperation (League of Nations, UN) and was amplified by Cold War fears. George H.W. Bush's 1991 speech using the phrase 'new world order' (meaning international cooperation post-Cold War) was misinterpreted as evidence. No credible evidence supports claims of a secret totalitarian world government conspiracy."
